# Connecting Git
Github is an open source version control system, which means it keeps track of changes in your source code. The best part of this is that it can switch back to a previous code version if an unfixable-bug occurs

       - Make sure to make the repository public and add a readme file, then click "Create"
     - Go back into Webstorm and on your open project, select VCS in the menu at the top
